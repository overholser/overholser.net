The Overholser Family Association (OFA) held its first family reunion in 1906 in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Since then, except for the war years, the
reunion has been held annually.

The OFA reunion is currently held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, during the
first weekend in August each year. The specific days, times and location in
Lancaster County of the OFA Reunion are announced in the second OFA Bulletin of
the year, which is distributed in July (also identified as the Summer issue).

If you are not receiving the bulletin, visit the [OFA Bulletins
page](/bulletins/) and look for the latest Summer edition of the Bulletin.
Meanwhile, we invite you to join us in any year for our Reunion. We will have
food and space for one and all!

**Next Reunion**:

**Out of an abundance of absolute caution related to COVID-19, the Overholser
Family Association Reunion will not be held on the first weekend of August 2020
as originally planned.**

Depending on the course of events between now and March 2021, a decision will be
made for the 2021 reunion with detailed information expected to be published in
the 2021 Winter and Summer OFA Bulletins.

Please plan to come join us in 2021. We will try to plan an extra special
reunion for that year. In the meantime, stay safe, keep your head clear-minded,
and enjoy the hunt for more ancestral stories.

More details can be found in the most recent issue of the [OFA
Bulletin](/bulletins/).
