The Overholser Family Association (OFA) held its first family reunion in 1906 in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Since then, except for the war years, the
reunion has been held annually.

The OFA reunion is currently held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, during the
first weekend in August each year. The specific days, times and location in
Lancaster County of the OFA Reunion are announced in the second OFA Bulletin of
the year, which is distributed in July (also identified as the Summer issue).

Meanwhile, we invite you to join us in any year for our Reunion. We will have
food and space for one and all!
