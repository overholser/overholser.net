The Overholser Family Association (OFA) held its first family reunion in 1906 in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Since then, except for the war years, the
reunion has been held annually. The OFA reunion is currently held in Lancaster
County, Pennsylvania, during the first weekend in August each year. The specific
days, times and location in Lancaster County of the OFA Reunion are announced in
the second OFA Bulletin of the year, which is distributed in July (also
identified as the Summer issue).

If you are not receiving the bulletin, visit the [OFA Bulletins
page](/bulletins/) and look for the latest Summer edition of the Bulletin.
Meanwhile, we invite you to join us in any year for our Reunion. We will have
food and space for one and all!
