The OFA’s most important contribution to Oberholtzer family descendants is The
Oberholtzer Book: A Foundation Book of Oberholtzer Immigrants and Unestablished
Lines, which was compiled and edited by Barbara B. Ford. Published by the OFA in
1995, The Oberholtzer Book chronicles the first generations of six “established”
Oberholtzer lines, and 18 other “unestablished” lines identified in Pennsylvania
and Ohio. Also documented are five Canadian lines, three Virginia lines, eight
female lines, and “odds and ends.” See OFA Book.

While the OFA Book is available for purchase, we realize that there are those
who prefer not to buy books. Therefore, the OFA has established a lookup
activity to assist current Overholser family researchers in connecting their
current family tree to the Overholser families of the past.

To request a lookup, please [contact the Overholser Family
Association](/contact/). Please include the names (husband and wife plus known
children), dates (birth, marriage, and death), and locations of your earliest
known Overholser ancestor. Please include “Overholser Lookups” in the subject of
the email. Finally, please include your US mail address.
