Family Coat of Arms – Oberholzer of Wald

> The coat of arms on this letterhead is the coat of arms which was adopted at
the annual reunion of the Overholser Family Association on August 14, 1958 at
Long’s Park, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This coat of arms was recommended by Dr.
Hans Klaui, Genealogical Investigation Office, 287 Rychenberg Street,
Oberwinterthur, Z.H. in a letter dated February 29, 1956 to J. Spencer
Overholser after several conversations with Dr. Winfred Overholser, then Supt.
of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. and after several exchanges of
letters with Spencer Overholser.

Abraham Overholser Who Died in 1971 in Morrisons Cove, Bedford Co, PA

> Abraham Overholser, his wife, and his family were part of a group of members
of the Church of the Brethren who lived in the Morrisons Cove area of northern
Bedford County, Pennsylvania. It appears that Abraham served as minister to the
congregation there. Page 126 of James M Sell’s A HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF THE
BRETHREN IN THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA states, “In a manuscript written
by Samuel Teeter who lived at New Enterprise and died in 1901, the following
statement is made concerning the beginning of the Yellow Creek congregation.

A Surveyors House in Paradise Township, Lancaster County, PA

> The year of 2010 was the 300th anniversary of the first German Settlement in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. There has been monthly activities in which to
celebrate the first major group of Europeans who were willing to make the
sacrificial journey from their familiar homelands to an unknown territory only
known as a “wilderness”. The dangers of unfamiliar Indian tribes as neighbors,
the old time superstitions they brought along from Europe, the erratic weather
at the end of the Little Ice Age, and multiple countries mingling together as
they competed for “new lands”, all played an integral part in the emotional
struggle in which the settlers had to struggle and survive.

The Oberholsers Origin

> The Oberholsers are undoubtedly of Swiss origin. The family is represented in
at least one Canton of Switzerland (Zurich) to this day. Kuhns says that the
name had its origin in one or all of several villages by that name in Canton
Bern. It is a matter of history that, together with a large body of defenseless
Mennonites, Martin Overholtz and Michael Oberholtz fled from relen tless
persecution in Canton Zurich, Switzerland into Alsace, above Strasburg, about
1672, where they remained till they emigrated in 1709 to London, where they
received assistance from Quakers to go to Pennsylvania. In 1710 the party to
which these Oberholtzers belonged received a grant of 10,000 acres of land in
Pequea, now included in Lancaster County. They were among the first settlers in
this region.

The Christian Oberholser Story by David Ray Heisey

> The Christian Oberholser, Jr. Family Letter to the Jacob E. Heisey Family
Describing the Confederate Invasion of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, in 1863

> The original was a presentation by Dr. David Ray Heisey at Messiah Village in
2008, and an edited version by Franklin County Historical Society is in their
2009 publication Kittochtinny.

> In looking through some old papers from my father’s collection recently, I
discovered a ledger book with many handwriting exercises, arithmetic exercises,
and handwritten essays that obviously had been written by a schoolboy. The name
at the top of the papers was Henry L. Heisey (1844-1912). I knew from my
genealogy records that he was my great-grandfather, but I never had known
anything about him. I then learned that he was a bishop in the Brethren in
Christ Church in the Manor-Pequea District, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The
finding of his papers sparked my interest in discovering more about him. My
subsequent research resulted in a published biographical article, “Henry L.
Heisey: Bishop of Manor-Pequea District, Lancaster County,” in Brethren in
Christ History and Life (2007).
