<p class="doc-desc">The coat of arms on this letterhead is the coat of arms which was adopted at the annual reunion of the Overholser Family Association on August 14, 1958 at Long's Park, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This coat of arms was recommended by Dr. Hans Klaui, Genealogical Investigation Office, 287 Rychenberg Street, Oberwinterthur, Z.H. in a letter dated February 29, 1956 to J. Spencer Overholser after several conversations with Dr. Winfred Overholser, then Supt. of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. and after several exchanges of letters with Spencer Overholser.</p>

<p class="doc-desc">Abraham Overholser, his wife, and his family were part of a group of members of the Church of the Brethren who lived in the Morrisons Cove area of northern Bedford County, Pennsylvania. It appears that Abraham served as minister to the congregation there. Page 126 of James M Sell's A HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF THE BRETHREN IN THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA states, "In a manuscript written by Samuel Teeter who lived at New Enterprise and died in 1901, the following statement is made concerning the beginning of the Yellow Creek congregation.</p>

<p class="doc-desc">The year of 2010 was the 300th anniversary of the first German Settlement in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. There has been monthly activities in which to celebrate the first major group of Europeans who were willing to make the sacrificial journey from their familiar homelands to an unknown territory only known as a "wilderness". The dangers of unfamiliar Indian tribes as neighbors, the old time superstitions they brought along from Europe, the erratic weather at the end of the Little Ice Age, and multiple countries mingling together as they competed for "new lands", all played an integral part in the emotional struggle in which the settlers had to struggle and survive.</p>

<div class="doc-title"><a href="/historical-documents/The-Oberholsers-Origin.pdf">The Oberholsers Origin</a></div>
<p class="doc-desc">The Oberholsers are undoubtedly of Swiss origin. The family is represented in at least one Canton of Switzerland (Zurich) to this day. Kuhns says that the name had its origin in one or all of several villages by that name in Canton Bern. It is a matter of history that, together with a large body of defenseless Mennonites, Martin Overholtz and Michael Oberholtz fled from relentless persecution in Canton Zurich, Switzerland into Alsace, above Strasburg, about 1672, where they remained till they emigrated in 1709 to London, where they received assistance from Quakers to go to Pennsylvania. In 1710 the party to which these Oberholtzers belonged received a grant of 10,000 acres of land in Pequea, now included in Lancaster County. They were among the first settlers in this region.</p>

<p class="doc-desc">The Christian Oberholser, Jr. Family Letter to the Jacob E. Heisey Family Describing the Confederate Invasion of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, in 1863. The original was a presentation by Dr. David Ray Heisey at Messiah Village in 2008, and an edited version by Franklin County Historical Society is in their 2009 publication Kittochtinny.</p>

<p class="doc-desc">The most complete account of the Pennsylvania German teamsters which were recruited by Benjamin Franklin for the support of the Braddock Expedition is given by Arthur D Graeff in "The Relations between the Pennsylvania Germans and the British Authorities (1750-1776)" published by the Pennsylvania German Society in Volume 47 of their proceedings in 1939.</p>

<div class="doc-title"><a href="/historical-documents/From-Adam-to-Alemanni-to-America.pdf">From Adam to Alemanni to America</a></div>
<p class="doc-desc">It is hard for us to imagine the ability to trace our family tree to the very beginning of civilization with God's first eternal creation - Adam and Eve. But amazing as God's grace is, so also He has preserved enough documentation to show our family tree directly linked through Noah to Adam. The above is the direct tree line to the Oberholtzer family. Many Swiss Anabaptist lines also come from the Alemani tribe and come through this same lineage.</p>
